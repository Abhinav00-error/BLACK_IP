# BLACK_IP
BLACK IP CHECKER is a command-line tool that helps cybersecurity professionals, system administrators, and ethical hackers check if an IP address is blacklisted on major DNS-based Blackhole Lists (DNSBLs).
Blacklisted IPs are often blocked by firewalls, email servers, and security systems due to past malicious activity, spam, or suspicious behavior. This tool performs real-time checks and provides direct removal request links to help clean flagged IPs.

ðŸ”¥ How BLACK IP CHECKER Works

This tool performs DNS queries against multiple IP reputation blacklists to determine if a given IP is flagged.
ðŸ”¹ Blacklists Checked:

  Spamhaus (zen.spamhaus.org)
  SpamCop (bl.spamcop.net)
  BarracudaCentral (b.barracudacentral.org)
  SORBS (dnsbl.sorbs.net)
  SPFBL (dnsbl.spfbl.net)

If an IP is found on any of these blacklists, the tool:
âœ… Lists the blacklists where the IP is flagged
âœ… Provides removal request links to help delist the IP
âœ… Displays a warning with clear red alert messages
